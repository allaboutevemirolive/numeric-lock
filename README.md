The puzzle states that for a `3-digit combination lock`, where each digit is a value between 0 and 9, the following clues are known about certain combinations:


```
Combination  Result

6-8-2        "One digit is right and in its place"

6-1-4        "One digit is right but in the wrong place"

2-0-6        "Two digits are right, but both are in the wrong place"

7-3-8        "All digits are wrong"

3-8-0        "One digit is right but in the wrong place"
```


The 3-digit password lock issue was resolved thanks to `JamieFlournoy`. I implement his solution from `Ruby` to `Java` and `Python`.

The solution includes `Bruteforce` algorithms for both Java and Python.
