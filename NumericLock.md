## NumericLockBruteForce Java Class

This Java class contains a series of methods that simulate a brute-force approach to solving a numeric lock puzzle. The class includes several helper methods that perform various checks on a guess made by the user, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the guess is correct or not.

### Approach and Strategy

The overall approach used by this class is to systematically generate and evaluate all possible combinations of three digits from 0 to 9 until a correct combination is found. To generate these combinations, the class uses three nested loops that iterate through all possible combinations of the three digits. For each combination generated, the class evaluates it using a series of rules that determine whether the combination satisfies the lock puzzle or not.

### Methods and Data Structures

The class contains several methods that perform various checks on a guess made by the user. These methods include:

- `matchesInPlace(int[] a, int[] b)`: This method compares two arrays of integers and returns an array of boolean values indicating whether the corresponding elements in the two arrays match or not.
- `numMatchesInPlace(int[] a, int[] b)`: This method uses the `matchesInPlace` method to count the number of digits in the guess that are in the correct position in the lock puzzle.
- `numDigitsRight(int[] a, int[] b)`: This method counts the number of digits in the guess that are in the lock puzzle but not in the correct position.
- `rule1(int[] guess)`: This method implements the first rule of the lock puzzle, which requires that one digit is in the correct position and one digit is in the lock puzzle but not in the correct position.
- `rule2(int[] guess)`: This method implements the second rule of the lock puzzle, which requires that one digit is in the lock puzzle but not in the correct position.
- `rule3(int[] guess)`: This method implements the third rule of the lock puzzle, which requires that two digits are in the lock puzzle but not in the correct position.
- `rule4(int[] guess)`: This method implements the fourth rule of the lock puzzle, which requires that no digits are in the lock puzzle.
- `rule5(int[] guess)`: This method implements the fifth rule of the lock puzzle, which requires that one digit is in the lock puzzle but not in the correct position.
- `printGuess(int[] guess)`: This method simply prints the guess made by the user.

The class uses two key data structures: an array of integers and an `ArrayList` of integers. The array of integers is used to store the guess made by the user, while the `ArrayList` of integers is used to store the digits in the lock puzzle.

### Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of the brute-force approach used by this class is O(10^3), since it involves iterating through all possible combinations of three digits from 0 to 9. The space complexity of the class is O(n), where n is the length of the guess made by the user.

### Edge Cases and Error Handling

This class does not perform any error handling or input validation. It assumes that the user enters a valid guess as an array of three integers between 0 and 9.

### Test Cases

This class does not include any test cases. However, one possible test case could involve testing the `evaluate` method with a known correct combination of digits.

### Optimizations and Alternative Solutions

One possible optimization for this class is to use a smarter algorithm to generate the combinations of digits. For example, instead of using three nested loops, the class could use a recursive algorithm that generates the combinations in a more efficient way.

Another alternative solution for this problem could be using a backtracking algorithm. The approach would be to generate all possible combinations of three digits from 0 to 9 and check each combination against the given rules until a correct combination is found or all combinations have been tried.

This approach has a worst-case time complexity of O(10^3), which is manageable for such a small input size. However, it might take longer than the current brute-force approach, which relies on the specific rules to reduce the search space.

Here's a sketch of the backtracking algorithm:

- Create a list of all possible combinations of three digits from 0 to 9.
- For each combination, check if it satisfies all the rules.
- If a combination satisfies all the rules, return it as the answer.
- If all combinations have been tried and none of them satisfy the rules, return null.

## Comparing print statements

Shorter and clean code
```
for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
    int[] guess = { i / 100, (i / 10) % 10, i % 10 };
    if (obj.evaluate(guess)) {
        validGuesses.add(guess);
    }
}
```
Maintainable code 
```
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
        for (int k = 0; k < 10; k++) {
            int[] guess = { i, j, k };
            if (obj.evaluate(guess)) {
                validGuesses.add(guess);
            }
        }
    }
}
